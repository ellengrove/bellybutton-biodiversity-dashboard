Users can explore the demographic information of a subject, a bubble chart displaying all OTUs (operational taxonomic unit, or groupings of like microbes) present in a sample, a horizontal barchart summarizing the top ten OTUs in the sample, and a gauge chart detailing the number of washes the subject's navel gets per week on average.
